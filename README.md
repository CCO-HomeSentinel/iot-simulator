# IoT Sensor Data Application

This project was created with Python and connected to a MongoDB NoSQL database to generate simulated data from IoT sensors.

## Overview

This project is an academic work developed in the IoT Systems course at SÃ£o Paulo Tech School. The main objective was to create an application using Python as the core language, connected to a NoSQL database (MongoDB), for logging occurrences of simulated data. Additionally, PostgreSQL was utilized to create the business logic for the project.



## Project Description

The application aims to demonstrate the integration of Python with MongoDB for handling IoT sensor data. It provides functionalities to generate simulated data from various sensors and store it in the MongoDB database. Furthermore, PostgreSQL is used to define the business rules and process the stored data for analysis.

## Features

-   Python-based application for IoT sensor data simulation.
-   MongoDB integration for storing sensor data.
-   PostgreSQL integration for defining project business logic.
-   Simulated data generation for various types of sensors.
-   Data processing and analysis capabilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
        
    `git clone https://github.com/leovasc5/iot-simulator.git` 
    
2.  Install the required dependencies:
       
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    
3.  Set up the MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases:
    
    -   Create a MongoDB database named `home_sentinel`.
    -   Create a PostgreSQL database named `home_sentinel`.
    -  Under development...
4.  Run the application:
    
    `python ./src/main.py`
